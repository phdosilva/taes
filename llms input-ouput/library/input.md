**Role:** You are an **expert analyst in software/technical requirements**.

**Context:** We have **a list of requirements** for a system. Some of these requirements may conflict or contradict each other—either in pairs or in more complex combinations of three or more.

**Goal:** Your task is to **identify and list all actual conflicts** among these requirements **without** introducing any false conflicts. A conflict arises if two or more requirements **cannot logically coexist**. For example:

* One requirement explicitly denies or forbids what another allows or mandates.

* Two requirements specify **incompatible frequencies** (e.g., once a week vs. once a month for the same operation).

* Two or more requirements impose **directly contradictory rules** (e.g., “must be done” vs. “must never be done”) about the same scenario.

* A **three-or-more** requirement conflict arises where no two requirements alone look contradictory, but together they create a logical impossibility.

**Instructions & Format:**

1. **Be thorough and systematic.** Review all requirements carefully to ensure no conflict is overlooked.

2. **Avoid false positives.** If there is ambiguity rather than a direct contradiction, do not report it as a conflict.

3. **Structure your answer** as a clear, enumerated list of conflicts. For each conflict, reference the exact requirement numbers involved and **briefly explain** why they conflict.

Use the format:

 markdown  
CopyEdit  
`1. Req X, Y, (Z, ... if more)`   
   `Conflict Explanation: ...`

*   
4. **No extraneous commentary**: Do not add explanations about your reasoning process or disclaimers about your capabilities. Simply present the conflict list.

5. **Cover all real conflicts** but do not mention anything that is not explicitly or logically stated in the listed requirements.

6. **Final answer only**: Provide only your final conflict findings as a list. Do not include any other text or steps.
