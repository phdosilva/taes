1. **Req 3, 6, 52**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Requirements 3 and 6 both state that the System Administration Module shall only be accessible through a Mac-compatible and macOS-compatible client, respectively, while requirement 52 states it shall be accessible through a web-browser or a Windows-compatible client. These requirements conflict as they describe exclusive access methods that cannot coexist.

2. **Req 30, 61, 77**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Requirement 30 states that the System Administration Module shall operate on a Windows server, requirement 61 states it shall operate on a Linux or Solaris server, and requirement 77 states it shall operate on a Windows server only. Requirements 61 and 77 explicitly conflict with each other, and both conflict with 30 due to the exclusivity of the server type.

3. **Req 57, 85, 95**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Requirement 57 states that the System Administration Module shall be accessible with screen-reading software, whereas requirements 85 and 95 state that it shall not be accessible with any accessibility software. This is a direct contradiction regarding the accessibility of the system.

4. **Req 106, 74, 98**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Requirement 106 restricts the System Administration Module to supporting no more than 25 locations, whereas requirements 74 and 98 state that the system must support 50 and 100 locations, respectively. These requirements impose incompatible constraints on the scale of the system.

5. **Req 116, 117, 118**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Requirements 116 and 117 classify all incremental backups as scheduled tasks and all scheduled tasks as full backups, but requirement 118 states that no incremental backup can ever be classified as a full backup. This creates a logical impossibility.

6. **Req 122, 123, 124**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Requirements 122 and 123 define the system's default SFTP mode as active, while requirement 124 requires Vendor A's SFTP connections to use passive mode, overriding any default settings. This indicates a specific conflict where the default setting cannot be both active and overridden to passive for the same vendor.

These conflicts highlight the challenges in system specification where requirements must be clearly non-conflicting and harmoniously integrated to ensure functional coherence and operability.
