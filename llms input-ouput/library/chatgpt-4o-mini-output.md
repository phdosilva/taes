1. Req 3, 6, 30, 42, 52, 77, 85   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 3, 6, and 30 require System Administration Module to be accessible only through specific client systems (Mac-compatible, macOS, or Windows server), while Req 42 requires it to be accessible only through a mobile application, and Req 77 mandates a Windows server. Req 85 explicitly prohibits accessibility with any accessibility software, which contradicts the flexibility required by the other requirements.

2. Req 7, 40, 41   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 7 specifies a non-relational database back-end, while Req 40 and 41 require a fully relational, SQL-based database back-end. These directly contradict each other regarding the type of database system used.

3. Req 48, 2   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 48 states the system shall only provide batch processing, while Req 2 specifies the system provides real-time processing. These two requirements cannot logically coexist as they define incompatible processing modes.

4. Req 17, 74, 106, 98   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 17 limits the system to support only up to 10 locations, while Req 74 and 98 require the system to support libraries with significantly more locations (50, 100). Req 106 further restricts the system to support only 25 locations, contradicting the need for scalability as described in Req 74 and 98\.

5. Req 29, 75, 121   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 29 mandates Google Chrome and Safari as supported browsers for web-based administration, while Req 75 prohibits Internet Explorer and Firefox. Req 121 requires exactly one browser, which conflicts with Req 29 that permits two different browsers.

6. Req 112, 110, 111   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 112 states that Item records must never be treated as equivalent to Order records, while Req 110 and 111 state that the system shall treat Item records as Bibliographic records for batch updates and treat Bibliographic records as Order records for validation. These contradict the treatment of Item and Order records.

7. Req 116, 117, 118   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 116 and 117 classify all incremental backups as scheduled tasks and full backups, respectively, but Req 118 specifies that no incremental backup can be classified as a full backup. This creates an irreconcilable conflict in how backups are classified.

8. Req 123, 124   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 123 mandates the default SFTP mode as active, while Req 124 requires all SFTP connections to Vendor A to use passive mode, overriding the default. These are incompatible mode settings for SFTP.
