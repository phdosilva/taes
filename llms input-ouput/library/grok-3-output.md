1\. Req 2, 48   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 2 mandates real-time processing, while Req 48 specifies only batch processing and explicitly excludes real-time processing.

2\. Req 3, 6   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 3 requires the System Administration Module to be accessible only through a Mac-compatible client, while Req 6 specifies it must be accessible only through a macOS-compatible client. These terms are synonymous, making the requirements redundant rather than conflicting, but no actual contradiction exists unless interpreted as mutually exclusive constraints.

3\. Req 7, 41   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 7 mandates a non-relational database back-end for the System Administration Module, while Req 41 requires a fully relational database back-end, which are mutually exclusive database types.

4\. Req 8, 57   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 8 states that System Administration shall not be accessible with screen-reading or accessibility software, while Req 57 mandates accessibility with screen-reading and other accessibility software, directly contradicting each other.

5\. Req 17, 74, 98    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 17 limits the System Administration Module to supporting up to 10 locations, while Req 74 requires support for 50 locations and Req 98 requires support for 100 locations, creating a logical impossibility as the system cannot simultaneously support only 10 and more than 10 locations.

6\. Req 17, 106   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 17 limits the System Administration Module to 10 locations, while Req 106 states it must not support more than 25 locations, which conflicts as 25 exceeds 10, but Req 106’s upper limit contradicts Req 17’s stricter cap.

7\. Req 29, 75   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 29 mandates that if web-browser based, System Administration shall be accessible only through Google Chrome and Apple Safari, while Req 75 forbids access through Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox but does not restrict Chrome or Safari, creating no direct conflict unless exclusivity is implied differently.

8\. Req 30, 61   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 30 requires the System Administration Module to operate on a Windows server, while Req 61 mandates it operate on a Linux or Solaris server, which are incompatible operating systems.

9\. Req 40, 7   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 40 requires the system to run on a fully relational, SQL-based database, while Req 7 mandates a non-relational database for the System Administration Module, conflicting as the module is part of the system.

10\. Req 42, 52   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 42 mandates that System Administration shall be accessible through a mobile application only, while Req 52 allows accessibility through a web-browser or Windows-compatible client, directly contradicting the exclusive access method.

11\. Req 74, 106   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 74 requires support for 50 locations, while Req 106 limits support to no more than 25 locations, making it impossible to satisfy both simultaneously.

12\. Req 77, 61   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 77 mandates that System Administration operate on a Windows server only, while Req 61 requires it to operate on a Linux or Solaris server, which are mutually exclusive.

13\. Req 85, 57   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 85 states that the System Administration Module shall not be accessible with any accessibility software, while Req 57 requires accessibility with screen-reading and other accessibility software, directly contradicting each other.

14\. Req 95, 57   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 95 forbids accessibility with screen-reading or any accessibility software, while Req 57 mandates such accessibility, creating a direct contradiction.

15\. Req 109, 75   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 109 mandates accessibility through Microsoft Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox if web-browser based, while Req 75 explicitly forbids access through these browsers, directly contradicting each other.

16\. Req 113, 115   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 113 requires all modules operable on Windows servers to also operate on Linux servers, while Req 115 forbids any module on Windows servers from operating on Solaris servers, but no direct conflict exists with Req 114 unless Solaris is implied as mandatory.

17\. Req 116, 117, 118   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 116 classifies all incremental backups as scheduled tasks, Req 117 classifies all scheduled tasks as full backups, and Req 118 states no incremental backup can be a full backup, creating a logical impossibility: incremental backups are scheduled tasks, scheduled tasks are full backups, yet incremental backups cannot be full backups.

18\. Req 119, 120, 121   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 119 and 120 mandate accessibility through Google Chrome and Apple Safari, respectively, while Req 121 requires web-browser-based access through exactly one browser only, making it impossible to support both Chrome and Safari simultaneously.

19\. Req 122, 123, 124   
    Conflict Explanation: Req 122 states SFTP connections to Vendor A follow the system’s default mode, Req 123 sets the default to active mode, and Req 124 requires Vendor A to use passive mode overriding defaults, creating a contradiction as the default (active) cannot coexist with the override (passive).
