1\. Req 2, 48    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 2 mandates real-time processing, while Req 48 explicitly requires batch-only processing, excluding real-time capabilities.

2\. Req 3, 6, 29, 42, 52, 75, 77, 85, 95, 109, 119, 120, 121    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 3 & 6 limit System Administration access exclusively to Mac-compatible clients.    
   \- Req 29, 52, 75, 109, 119, 120, 121 allow or mandate web-browser-based access through browsers on multiple OS platforms.    
   \- Req 42 mandates mobile-app-only access.    
   \- Req 77 requires Windows-server-only operation, implying compatibility with Windows clients.    
   \- Req 85 & 95 explicitly forbid use with accessibility software, conflicting directly with Req 57, which mandates accessibility software compatibility.

   Together, these requirements create irreconcilable contradictions about client accessibility methods, platforms, browsers, and accessibility software.

3\. Req 7, 40, 41    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 7 mandates a non-relational database back-end for the System Administration Module, while Req 41 explicitly mandates a fully relational database. Req 40 further reinforces the requirement for a relational database for the overall system, deepening the contradiction.

4\. Req 17, 74, 98, 106    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 17 limits support to a maximum of 10 locations.    
   \- Req 106 limits support to 25 locations maximum.    
   \- Req 74 requires support for at least 50 locations.    
   \- Req 98 expands this further, requiring support for at least 100 locations.

   These capacity constraints directly conflict in terms of maximum supported locations and operational scale.

5\. Req 30, 61, 77, 113, 114, 115    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 30 & 77 explicitly require System Administration Module operation only on Windows servers.    
   \- Req 61 mandates operation on Linux or Solaris servers.    
   \- Req 113 states all modules operating on Windows must also operate on Linux servers.    
   \- Req 114 requires that Linux modules also run on Solaris.    
   \- Req 115 explicitly forbids modules running on Windows servers from running on Solaris.

   These conflicting server-platform specifications are impossible to satisfy simultaneously.

6\. Req 116, 117, 118    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 116 classifies incremental backups as scheduled tasks.    
   \- Req 117 classifies all scheduled tasks as full backups.    
   \- Req 118 explicitly states no incremental backup can ever be classified as a full backup.

   Collectively, these definitions create a logical impossibility regarding incremental and full backups.

7\. Req 122, 123, 124    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 122 demands Vendor A's SFTP connections adhere to default (active) mode (Req 123).    
   \- Req 124 explicitly requires Vendor A's SFTP connections to always use passive mode, overriding defaults.

   These requirements directly contradict each other concerning SFTP mode usage for Vendor A.

8\. Req 85, 95, 57    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 85 & 95 prohibit accessibility software from accessing System Administration.    
   \- Req 57 explicitly mandates compatibility with accessibility software (screen-readers, magnification, etc.).

   These requirements directly conflict on accessibility software compatibility.

9\. Req 109, 75, 119, 120, 121    
   Conflict Explanation:    
   \- Req 109 mandates compatibility with Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers.    
   \- Req 75 explicitly forbids access via Internet Explorer and Firefox.    
   \- Req 119 mandates access via Google Chrome, while Req 120 mandates Apple Safari.    
   \- Req 121 restricts access through exactly one browser.

   These browser compatibility specifications directly conflict in multiple ways.
