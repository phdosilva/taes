1\. Req 3, 4    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 3 states the system sends an SMS notification after an account is locked, while Req 4 forbids sending an SMS notification if an email notification has already been sent (which always happens per Req 2). These requirements cannot coexist logically.

2\. Req 5, 6    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 5 mandates yearly invoicing for broker accounts, while Req 6 mandates monthly invoicing for the same accounts. Both frequencies are incompatible for the same invoicing scenario.

3\. Req 7, 47    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 7 explicitly forbids deleting invoices, but Req 47 indicates that flagged invoices (older than 60 days per Req 46\) may be scheduled for potential deletion, creating a direct contradiction.

4\. Req 7, 40 vs. 42    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 7 and Req 40 explicitly forbid deleting invoices, but Req 42 permits brokers to delete subscriber accounts along with associated invoices, creating a direct contradiction.

5\. Req 10, 11    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 10 forbids PBX accounts from having virtual circuits, while Req 11 implies PBX accounts could have virtual circuits, only deactivating them if unpaid. These two requirements directly contradict.

6\. Req 12, 13    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 12 grants brokers direct access to the rate table, while Req 13 restricts rate table access exclusively to administrators, requiring brokers to have a created access list instead, causing logical inconsistency.

7\. Req 14, 15, 39, 44    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 14 and 44 require the system to automatically assign unique numbers to subscription accounts at registration, whereas Req 15 and 39 explicitly allow users or brokers to specify custom identification numbers. Both automatic assignment and user-defined assignment of the same identifier cannot coexist logically.

8\. Req 32, 45    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 32 explicitly forbids brokers from modifying data in closed accounts, while Req 45 explicitly allows brokers to revise data in closed accounts, directly contradicting each other.

9\. Req 33, 34    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 33 requires a monthly audit of all accounts, while Req 34 requires a weekly audit of all accounts, specifying two incompatible frequencies for the same auditing task.

10\. Req 41, 43    
    Conflict Explanation: Req 41 requires the system to highlight overdue invoices on the dashboard, while Req 43 explicitly forbids highlighting overdue invoices, directly contradicting each other.

11\. Req 47, 48    
    Conflict Explanation: Req 47 states overdue invoices (older than 60 days per Req 46\) can potentially be deleted during cleanup, while Req 48 explicitly forbids deleting overdue invoices, creating a direct contradiction.

12\. Req 49, 50, 51    
    Conflict Explanation: Req 49 and 50 together allow admin users to view and reopen closed broker accounts, but Req 51 explicitly forbids admin users from reopening closed broker accounts. These three requirements create a logical impossibility when combined.

13\. Req 52, 53, 54    
    Conflict Explanation: Req 52 and 53 require payment history recording and monthly invoice table backups when integrated with the Payment Gateway, but Req 54 explicitly forbids monthly backups of the invoice table under the same condition, creating a direct conflict.

14\. Req 55, 56, 57    
    Conflict Explanation: Req 55 requires inactive foreign accounts to be locked and subsequently closed after 30 days per Req 56, whereas Req 57 explicitly forbids ever closing inactive foreign accounts, creating a logical impossibility.
