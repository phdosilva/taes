1. Req 5, 6  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 5 requires invoicing broker accounts once per year using CDR, while Req 6 mandates invoicing once per month. These are incompatible frequencies for the same operation.

2. Req 4, 2, 3  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 4 states that if a user has already received a notification via email, they will not receive the same notification via SMS. However, Req 2 and 3 imply that both an email and a SMS notification are sent once an account is locked, contradicting Req 4\.

3. Req 12, 13  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 12 allows brokers to access the rate table, while Req 13 restricts access to only the administrator, who creates an access list. These requirements directly contradict who can access the rate table.

4. Req 7, 40, 47, 48  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 7 and 40 forbid the deletion of invoices, while Req 47 states that all flagged invoices must be scheduled for a cleanup cycle, which may include potential deletion. Req 48 also states that overdue invoices shall never be deleted, reinforcing the contradiction with Req 47\.

5. Req 41, 43  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 41 states that the system shall highlight overdue invoices in the dashboard, whereas Req 43 explicitly states that the system shall not highlight overdue invoices in the dashboard. These are direct contradictions about how to handle overdue invoices in the dashboard.

6. Req 49, 50, 51  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 49 allows any admin user to view closed broker accounts, and Req 50 permits any user who can view these accounts to reopen them. However, Req 51 states that no admin user may reopen a closed broker account, creating a logical impossibility among these requirements.

7. Req 53, 54  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 53 implies that if the system records payment history in the invoice table, it must perform monthly backups of that table. Req 54 states that if the system integrates with the Payment Gateway, it shall not perform monthly backups of the invoice table, conflicting with the condition set in Req 53\.

8. Req 55, 56, 57  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 55 and 56 dictate that any foreign account that becomes inactive shall automatically be locked and then closed after 30 days. Req 57, however, explicitly states that no inactive foreign account shall ever be closed, contradicting the closure of accounts as stated in Req 56\.
