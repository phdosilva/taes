1. **Req 8, 9, 4**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 8 states ETCS shall not require any driver input for level transitions, while Req 9 and Req 4 suggest that ETCS should seek an acknowledgement from the driver if the responsibility increases, or in some cases, if the transition needs acknowledgment. These create a contradiction on whether driver input is necessary for level transitions.

2. **Req 12, 10, 56**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 12 and Req 10 both discuss providing track-to-train information, with Req 12 specifying continuous transmission via radio, while Req 10 specifies that ETCS should not require such information via radio. Req 56 further limits track-to-train information to radio only. These contradict each other.

3. **Req 6, 13**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 6 states ETCS must be compatible with existing national systems, while Req 13 states ETCS shall not be compatible with any national systems listed in the CCS TSI. This is a direct contradiction regarding system compatibility.

4. **Req 37, 38**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 37 specifies ETCS is functional up to 100 km/h, while Req 38 specifies a maximum train speed of 500 km/h. These are incompatible speed requirements.

5. **Req 28, 37, 38**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 28 suggests ETCS must allow manual speed control regardless of maximum train speed, but Req 37 (100 km/h) and Req 38 (500 km/h) conflict with each other regarding the speed at which ETCS should operate.

6. **Req 42, 9, 4**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 42 states ETCS shall not provide any information to the driver during level transitions, while Req 9 and Req 4 imply the system must seek driver acknowledgement in certain cases. These contradict each other in terms of driver interaction.

7. **Req 19, 25**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 19 and Req 25 both state that ETCS cannot supervise shunting movements, but Req 53 (which implies ETCS should be able to supervise such movements) conflicts with these.

8. **Req 43, 46**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 43 mandates that ETCS should automatically switch to the lowest available level, even if not equipped for it, while Req 46 states that the onboard system should switch to the highest level according to trackside priority, creating conflicting behavior on level transitions.

9. **Req 52, 4**  
    **Conflict Explanation:** Req 52 states that ETCS shall not require the driver to acknowledge any level transitions, even when requested by trackside, while Req 4 requires the driver to acknowledge level transitions if requested from trackside. This is a contradiction on driver acknowledgement requirements.

10. **Req 56, 44**  
     **Conflict Explanation:** Req 56 specifies that track-to-train information should only be provided via radio and not via balises, while Req 44 allows for information to be provided via balises, conflicting on the method of information transmission.

11. **Req 33, 30**  
     **Conflict Explanation:** Req 33 and Req 30 both specify that ETCS shall initiate a brake application when passing a level transition for which the system is not equipped. However, they appear to provide duplicate or conflicting instructions regarding the behavior of the ETCS in these scenarios.

12. **Req 61, 38**  
     **Conflict Explanation:** Req 61 specifies that ETCS only provides driver information if the train speed is below 400 km/h, while Req 38 specifies a maximum train speed of 500 km/h, creating a conflict about when driver information can be provided.

13. **Req 27, 62**  
     **Conflict Explanation:** Req 27 specifies that transitions between two operational states must ensure the same protection as the least restrictive state, while Req 62 suggests that supervision during transitions must at least ensure the same protection, which might imply a higher level of supervision than Req 27â€™s stipulation. This creates potential conflicting supervision levels.
