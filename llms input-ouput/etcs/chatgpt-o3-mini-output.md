1. Req 4, 5, 9, 15, 47 vs. Req 8, 52  
    Conflict Explanation: Some requirements mandate that the driver must acknowledge level transitions (4, 5, 9, 15, 47\) while others state that no driver input is required (8, 52).

2. Req 3, 12 vs. Req 10 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: Requirements 3 and 12 specify that track-to-train information is provided via continuous transmission media (radio), whereas Requirement 10 prohibits providing such information by radio.

3. Req 6, 64, 58 vs. Req 13 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: While Requirements 6, 64, and 58 require ETCS to be compatible with national systems (with varying conditions), Requirement 13 explicitly forbids compatibility with any national systems.

4. Req 18, 37, 38, 49 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: The maximum train speed limits are inconsistent—Requirement 18 requires functionality up to 600 km/h, Requirement 37 limits it to 100 km/h, and Requirements 38 and 49 set it at 500 km/h.

5. Req 19, 25 vs. Req 45, 53 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: Requirements 19 and 25 state that ETCS shall not supervise shunting (and train) movements, while Requirements 45 and 53 mandate supervision of train and shunting movements.

6. Req 23, 24 vs. Req 42 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: Requirements 23 and 24 require that the driver is provided with information for safe driving, yet Requirement 42 forbids providing any information to the driver during level transitions.

7. Req 23, 24 vs. Req 61 ok   
    Conflict Explanation: Requirements 23 and 24 call for continuous driver safety information, but Requirement 61 restricts this provision to when the train speed is below 400 km/h.

8. Req 31, 46 vs. Req 43 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: Requirements 31 and 46 specify that the onboard system must switch to the highest level available, while Requirement 43 demands switching to the lowest available level.

9. Req 44 vs. Req 56  
    Conflict Explanation: Requirement 44 permits track-to-train information via intermittent transmission media (including balises), whereas Requirement 56 restricts such information to being provided only via radio.

10. Req 36, 41 vs. Req 63  
     Conflict Explanation: Requirements 36 and 41 state that national values, once received, remain valid permanently (even if the onboard equipment is switched off), conflicting with Requirement 63 which limits their validity to a limited time.
