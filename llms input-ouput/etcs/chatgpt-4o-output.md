Req 6, 13 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 6 states ETCS shall be compatible with national systems listed in the CCS TSI; Req 13 states ETCS shall not be compatible with any such systems.


Req 3, 10 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 3 mandates basic track-to-train communication via radio; Req 10 forbids ETCS from using radio for track-to-train or train-to-track information.


Req 12, 10 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 12 (identical to Req 3) mandates radio communication; Req 10 forbids it.


Req 56, 44 / 55 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 56 states track-to-train info shall only be provided via radio, while Req 44 and 55 allow for intermittent media such as balises.


Req 8, 4 / 5 / 9 / 11 / 47 / 50 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 8 says no driver input is required for level transitions; Reqs 4, 5, 9, 11, 47, 50 require driver acknowledgements in specific transition scenarios.


Req 52, 4 / 5 / 9 / 11 / 47 / 50 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 52 states ETCS shall not require the driver to acknowledge any level transitions; other requirements mandate acknowledgements.


Req 37, 18 / 38 / 49 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 37 limits ETCS to 100 km/h; Reqs 18, 38, and 49 require it to be functional up to 500 or 600 km/h.


Req 25, 45 / 53 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 25 says ETCS shall not supervise train or shunting movements; Reqs 45 and 53 state it shall be able to do so.


Req 42, 23 / 24 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 42 says ETCS shall not provide any info to the driver during level transitions; Reqs 23 and 24 say ETCS must provide info to allow safe driving, which may include level transitions.


Req 13, 64 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 13 forbids compatibility with CCS TSI-listed systems; Req 64 mandates compatibility.


Req 13, 58 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 13 prohibits any compatibility with national systems listed in the CCS TSI; Req 58 allows conditional compatibility (if those systems are also ETCS-equipped).


Req 40 / 60, 63 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 40 and 60 require ETCS to receive and use national values from trackside; Req 63 states these values will expire and be deleted, conflicting with Req 36 / 41 which state they remain valid indefinitely.


Req 36 / 41, 63 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 36 and 41 state received national values remain valid even after onboard equipment is switched off; Req 63 says values expire and are deleted after a limited time.


Req 43, 30 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 43 states ETCS will switch to lowest level even if not equipped for it; Req 30 mandates brake application if transitioning to an unequipped level.


Req 43, 31 / 46 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 43 states switch to lowest level; Reqs 31 and 46 require switching to highest equipped level based on trackside priority.


Req 61, 23 / 24 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 61 restricts ETCS from providing driver info above 400 km/h; Reqs 23 and 24 require ETCS to provide info for safe driving regardless of speed.


Req 58, 6 / 64 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 58 allows compatibility only if national systems are ETCS-equipped; Reqs 6 and 64 require compatibility regardless.


Req 30, 43 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 30 mandates brake if train passes to unequipped level; Req 43 allows switching to an unequipped lowest level.


Req 3 / 12, 44 / 55 / 56 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 3 and 12 require radio for transmission; Req 44 and 55 allow balises; Req 56 forbids balises, requiring only radioâ€”these are mutually exclusive transmission methods.


Req 35 / 51, 43 / 30 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 35 and 51 require trains to run on only the levels they are equipped for; Req 43 and 30 imply trains may encounter unequipped levels and respond (e.g., by switching or braking), leading to inconsistency.


Req 18, 37 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 18 requires ETCS functional to 600 km/h; Req 37 limits it to 100 km/h.


Req 38, 37 
 Conflict Explanation: Req 38 requires functionality to 500 km/h; Req 37 limits it to 100 km/h.
