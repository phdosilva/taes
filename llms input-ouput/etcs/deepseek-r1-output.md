1\. Req 6, 13   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 6 mandates compatibility with existing national systems, while Req 13 explicitly states ETCS shall not be compatible with them.  

2\. Req 18, 37, 38, 49   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 18 specifies a maximum speed of 600 km/h, Req 37 limits to 100 km/h, and Reqs 38/49 set it to 500 km/h. These are incompatible speed limits.  

3\. Req 19, 45   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 19 prohibits ETCS from supervising shunting movements, while Req 45 mandates it.  

4\. Req 25, 45  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 25 states ETCS cannot supervise train or shunting movements, conflicting with Req 45's requirement to supervise both.  

5\. Req 3, 10   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 3 requires basic track-to-train communication via continuous media (radio), while Req 10 prohibits ETCS from using continuous media for this purpose.  

6\. Req 44, 56   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 44 allows intermittent media (e.g., balises) for track-to-train info, while Req 56 restricts it to radio only.  

7\. Req 8, 4, 5, 9, 11, 20, 47, 50   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 8 and 52 state no driver input is required for level transitions, conflicting with Reqs 4, 5, 9, 11, 20, 47, and 50, which mandate driver acknowledgments under specific conditions.  

8\. Req 36, 41, 63   
   Conflict Explanation: Reqs 36/41 state national values remain valid even if equipment is off, while Req 63 mandates their automatic deletion after a limited time.  

9\. Req 42, 1, 2, 23, 24, 59   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 42 prohibits providing driver info during transitions, conflicting with Reqs 1, 2, 23, 24, and 59, which require displaying operational status/application level/safety info.  

10\. Req 43, 31, 46  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 43 requires switching to the lowest level (even if unequipped), while Reqs 31/46 mandate switching to the highest equipped level.  

11\. Req 58, 6, 64  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 58 restricts compatibility to national systems with ETCS, conflicting with Reqs 6/64, which require compatibility regardless.  

12\. Req 61, 18, 38, 49    
    Conflict Explanation: Req 61 limits driver info provision to speeds below 400 km/h, conflicting with Reqs 18/38/49, which require functionality at higher speeds (500-600 km/h).
