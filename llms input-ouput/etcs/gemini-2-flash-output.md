1. Req 3, 10, 12, 44, 55, 56 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 3, 12 state that ETCS shall provide track to train information via continuous radio transmission. Req 10 states that ETCS shall not provide track to train information via radio. Req 44, 55 state that basic track to train information is via intermittent media like balises. Req 56 states that track to train information shall only be provided via radio and not balises.

2. Req 6, 13, 58, 64 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 6 and 64 state that ETCS shall be compatible with existing national systems. Req 13 states that ETCS shall not be compatible with any national systems. Req 58 states that ETCS is only compatible with national systems that are also equipped with ETCS, thus creating a limitation on the compatibility.

3. Req 7, 8 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 7 states transitions while moving shall in principle occur automatically. Req 8 states ETCS shall not require any driver input for level transitions, implying all transitions are automatic.

4. Req 4, 52, 47 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 4 and 47 state that the driver shall acknowledge level transitions, if requested, and if not, a brake application is initiated. Req 52 states that ETCS shall not require the driver to acknowledge any level transitions.

5. Req 18, 37 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 18 states ETCS is required to be functional up to 600 km/h. Req 37 states ETCS shall only be functional up to 100 km/h.

6. Req 18, 38 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 18 states ETCS is required to be functional up to 600 km/h. Req 38 states ETCS is required to be functional up to 500 km/h.

7. Req 19, 25, 45, 53 ok   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 19 and 25 state that ETCS shall not be able to supervise train or shunting movements. Req 45 and 53 state that ETCS shall be able to supervise train and shunting movements.

8. Req 28, 61 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 28 states ETCS shall allow for manual speed control at all times. Req 61 states that ETCS shall only provide driver information for safe driving if the train speed is below 400 km/h, which implies that it cannot provide information for safe driving, and therefore would not allow manual speed control, above 400km/h.

9. Req 31, 43, 46 ok  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 31 and 46 state the onboard shall switch to the highest level. Req 43 states the onboard shall switch to the lowest level.

10. Req 36, 63, 41 ok  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 36 and 41 state that national values shall remain valid even if the onboard equipment is switched off. Req 63 states that national values received from the trackside shall be valid only for a limited time.
