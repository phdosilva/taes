1\. Req 6, 13    
   Conflict Explanation: Req 6 requires compatibility with existing national systems listed in CCS TSI, while Req 13 explicitly forbids compatibility with these national systems.

2\. Req 8, 4, 5, 9, 47, 50   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 8 states ETCS shall not require driver input for level transitions, conflicting directly with Reqs 4, 5, 9, 47, and 50, all of which mandate driver acknowledgment for specific transitions.

3\. Req 3, 12, 10   
   Conflict Explanation: Reqs 3 and 12 require continuous transmission of basic track-to-train information via radio, whereas Req 10 explicitly states ETCS shall not be required to provide such continuous transmission.

4\. Req 19, 25, 45, 53  
   Conflict Explanation: Reqs 19 and 25 forbid ETCS from supervising shunting (and train) movements, while Reqs 45 and 53 explicitly require ETCS to supervise these movements.

5\. Req 18, 37, 38, 49   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 18 specifies ETCS must support speeds up to 600 km/h, whereas Req 37 limits functionality strictly to 100 km/h, directly conflicting. Similarly, Req 38 and 49 limit functionality to 500 km/h, conflicting with Req 18 and Req 37\.

6\. Req 28, 61   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 28 requires ETCS to always allow manual driver control regardless of maximum speed, but Req 61 restricts providing necessary safe driving information only when below 400 km/h, implicitly preventing manual driver control above 400 km/h.

7\. Req 33, 43   
   Conflict Explanation: Req 33 requires brake application if the train transitions to an unequipped level, whereas Req 43 mandates automatic switching to the lowest level even if the train isn't equipped, thus creating contradictory behavior.

8\. Req 29, 36, 41, 63   
   Conflict Explanation: Reqs 36 and 41 state national values, once received, remain valid permanently even after equipment shutdown. Req 63 directly contradicts this by requiring national values to expire automatically after a limited time.

9\. Req 44, 55, 56   
   Conflict Explanation: Reqs 44 and 55 permit intermittent track-to-train information via balises (potentially supported by radio), whereas Req 56 explicitly requires basic track-to-train information only via radio, explicitly forbidding balises.

10\. Req 58, 6, 64  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 58 restricts ETCS compatibility only with national systems equipped with ETCS, conflicting with Req 6 and Req 64, which require compatibility with existing national systems listed in CCS TSI without this additional condition.
