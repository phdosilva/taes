1. Req 6, 13 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 6 states that ETCS shall be compatible with existing national systems, whereas Requirement 13 explicitly states that ETCS shall not be compatible with any national systems. These two requirements are direct opposites.

2. Req 8, 4, 52 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 8 states that ETCS shall not require any driver input for level transitions, conflicting with Requirement 4, which requires driver acknowledgment for level transitions. Requirement 52 further conflicts by stating ETCS shall not require the driver to acknowledge any level transitions, even if requested.

3. Req 10, 3 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 10 states that ETCS shall not be required to provide any track-to-train or train-to-track information via continuous transmission media, directly contradicting Requirement 3, which mandates basic track to train and train to track information via continuous transmission media.

4. Req 18, 37, 38 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 18 states that ETCS is required to be functional to a maximum train speed of 600 km/h, conflicting with Requirements 37 and 38, which state that ETCS shall only be functional up to 100 km/h and 500 km/h respectively. These requirements impose conflicting maximum speeds.

5. Req 19, 45, 53 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 19 states that ETCS shall not be able to supervise shunting movements, directly contradicting Requirements 45 and 53, which state that ETCS shall be able to supervise train and shunting movements.

6. Req 25, 45, 53 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 25 states that ETCS shall not be able to supervise train or shunting movements, which contradicts Requirements 45 and 53 that state ETCS shall be able to supervise these movements.

7. Req 42, 23, 24 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 42 states that ETCS shall not provide any information to the driver during level transitions, conflicting with Requirements 23 and 24, which emphasize the need to provide the driver with information to ensure safe operation of the train.

8. Req 44, 56 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 44 specifies that basic track to train information can be supported by infill, transmitted via balise, loop, or radio, while Requirement 56 mandates that basic track to train information shall only be provided via radio, explicitly excluding other mediums like balises.

9. Req 58, 13 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 58 states that ETCS shall only be compatible with national systems that are equipped with ETCS, conflicting with Requirement 13, which states that ETCS shall not be compatible with any national systems listed in the CCS TSI.

10. Req 61, 23 Conflict Explanation: Requirement 61 restricts ETCS's provision of safety information to the driver only if the train speed is below 400 km/h, while Requirement 23 mandates ETCS to provide the driver with information to drive the train safely without specifying a speed limit, leading to a conflict regarding the conditions under which safety information is provided.
