1. **Req 31, 43, 46**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 31 and Req 46 mandate switching to the **highest** available level, while Req 43 mandates switching to the **lowest** available level. These instructions cannot both be satisfied.

2. **Req 19, 25 vs. Req 45, 53**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 19 and Req 25 say ETCS **shall not** supervise shunting (or any) movements, whereas Req 45 and Req 53 say ETCS **shall** be able to supervise train and shunting movements.

3. **Req 4, 5, 9, 11, 47, 50 vs. Req 8, 52**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 4, 5, 9, 11, 47, and 50 require or assume **driver acknowledgement** (input) in certain level transitions. Req 8 and Req 52 forbid requiring **any** driver acknowledgement.

4. **Req 6, 64 vs. Req 13 vs. Req 58**  
    Conflict Explanation:

   * Req 6 and Req 64 demand ETCS **be compatible** with national systems.

   * Req 13 demands ETCS **not** be compatible with those same systems.

   * Req 58 permits compatibility **only** if the national systems also have ETCS.  
      These conditions cannot all hold simultaneously.

5. **Req 18, 37, 38, 49**  
    Conflict Explanation:

   * Req 18 says ETCS must function up to **600 km/h**.

   * Req 37 says ETCS shall **only** be functional up to **100 km/h**.

   * Req 38 and Req 49 both require functionality up to **500 km/h**.  
      No single system can satisfy these conflicting maximum-speed requirements simultaneously.

6. **Req 42 vs. Req 2, 59 (and by extension Req 23, 24\)**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 42 forbids providing **any** information to the driver **during level transitions**, yet Req 2 and Req 59 require that the current application level be indicated on the DMI (which necessarily includes transitions). Req 23 and Req 24 also require ETCS to give the driver essential safety information at all times.

7. **Req 36, 41 vs. Req 63**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 36 and Req 41 state that national values, once received, **remain valid** (even if onboard is switched off). Req 63 says national values are **valid only for a limited time** and then are automatically deleted. These cannot both be true.

8. **Req 61 vs. Req 23, 24**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 61 says ETCS shall **only** provide the driver with safety‑related information **if the train speed is below 400 km/h**, while Req 23 and Req 24 require providing such information **unconditionally** (i.e., at all speeds). This creates a direct contradiction for speeds above 400 km/h.

9. **Req 56 vs. Req 44, 55**  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 56 says basic track‑to‑train information shall **only** be provided via radio and **not** via balises. In contrast, Req 44 and Req 55 explicitly allow providing that same information via **balises**, loops, or radio.
