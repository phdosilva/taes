1\. Req 3, 10  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 3 mandates basic track-to-train and train-to-track information via continuous transmission media (radio), while Req 10 explicitly states that ETCS shall not be required to provide such information via radio, directly contradicting Req 3\.

2\. Req 3, 44  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 3 requires basic track-to-train information via continuous transmission media (radio), while Req 44 specifies it via intermittent transmission media (e.g., balises), presenting incompatible transmission methods for the same information.

3\. Req 4, 8  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 4 requires the driver to acknowledge level transitions if requested from trackside, with brakes applied if not acknowledged, while Req 8 states ETCS shall not require any driver input for level transitions, directly contradicting the acknowledgment requirement.

4\. Req 5, 8  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 5 mandates driver acknowledgment for transitions to and from national Operation (STM), while Req 8 states ETCS shall not require any driver input for level transitions, creating a direct contradiction for STM transitions.

5\. Req 6, 13  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 6 requires ETCS to be compatible with existing national systems listed in the CCS TSI without interference, while Req 13 states ETCS shall not be compatible with any such systems, presenting a direct contradiction.

6\. Req 7, 9  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 7 states that transitions while the train is moving shall occur automatically, while Req 9 requires driver acknowledgment for automatic transitions (except to/from STM) if responsibility increases, contradicting the automatic nature by introducing a manual step.

7\. Req 8, 9  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 8 states ETCS shall not require driver input for level transitions, while Req 9 requires driver acknowledgment for automatic transitions (except to/from STM) if responsibility increases, directly contradicting the no-input rule.

8\. Req 10, 12  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 10 states ETCS shall not be required to provide track-to-train or train-to-track information via continuous transmission media (radio), while Req 12 mandates such information via radio, presenting a direct contradiction.

9\. Req 18, 37  
   Conflict Explanation: Req 18 requires ETCS to be functional up to a maximum train speed of 600 km/h, while Req 37 limits functionality to 100 km/h, specifying incompatible maximum speeds.

10\. Req 19, 45  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 19 states ETCS shall not be able to supervise shunting movements, while Req 45 requires ETCS to supervise train and shunting movements, directly contradicting the capability for shunting.

11\. Req 23, 42  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 23 mandates ETCS to provide the driver with information to drive safely, while Req 42 states ETCS shall not provide any information during level transitions, conflicting when transitions occur as safe driving information is still required.

12\. Req 25, 45  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 25 states ETCS shall not be able to supervise train or shunting movements, while Req 45 requires ETCS to supervise both, presenting a direct contradiction.

13\. Req 31, 43  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 31 requires the onboard to switch to the highest level for which it is equipped during a transition to a line with multiple levels, while Req 43 mandates switching to the lowest level available, even if not equipped, specifying incompatible switching rules.

14\. Req 35, 43  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 35 implies compatibility and operation across specified ETCS levels (e.g., 3, 2, 1, 0\) for equipped trains, while Req 43 requires switching to the lowest level even if not equipped, contradicting the ability to operate only on equipped levels.

15\. Req 38, 37  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 38 requires ETCS to be functional up to 500 km/h, while Req 37 limits functionality to 100 km/h, presenting incompatible maximum speed requirements.

16\. Req 44, 56  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 44 specifies basic track-to-train information via intermittent transmission media (e.g., balises), while Req 56 mandates it shall only be provided via radio and not balises, directly contradicting the transmission method.

17\. Req 52, 4  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 52 states ETCS shall not require driver acknowledgment for level transitions even if requested from trackside, while Req 4 mandates driver acknowledgment if requested, with brakes applied if not acknowledged, presenting a direct contradiction.

18\. Req 63, 36  
    Conflict Explanation: Req 63 states national values received from trackside are valid only for a limited time and then deleted, while Req 36 requires them to remain valid even if the onboard equipment is switched off, contradicting the validity duration.
